Coding standards are extremely important for ensuring a consistent quality of 
coding output from the studio. This ensures that your coding skills are up to
standard, that you're working in the most efficient way, and that anyone who 
must pick up your work, will be able to hit the ground running.

These standards are already agreed and must be obeyed until changes are debated
and published here.
