  Obviously every project is different, but this SOW Template serves as a baseline document which we can review and edit as time goes on.  Edits made should be generic enough to be applicable to all projects.  Please make suggested edits and inform `Peter Gasston <mailto:peter@rehabstudio.com>`_ of what you've edited and why.

- `Red Bull :: Build and Deployment Process Review <https://docs.google.com/a/rehabstudio.com/document/d/1humc_GAfWQwqr4BGNeRd2zIOXbBrmnnvpbHk6yR-Hnw/edit#>`_

  Red Bull projects are typically huge and have very detailed architectured, from both a front-end and back-end perspective.  This document aims to provide a developer guide to RedBull projects.
