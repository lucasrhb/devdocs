About
=====

This service provides a central platform to host all our development guidelines and agreed Coding Standards.
This helps to ensure we have a known place-to-go to check the agreed 'rehab way' of doing things.  

All of this is open to debate and change, though this is not the forum for such debate. Slack, Discourse, Email 
and human conversation is the medium for debate. Agreed policies are then posted here, and must be adhered to
until such time as we agree to change, based on the outcome of debates.

Formats
=======

You can view this documentation online at http://devdocs.rehabstudio.com, as an `eBook here <./devdocs.epub>`_ or as a `PDF here <./devdocs.pdf>`_.
